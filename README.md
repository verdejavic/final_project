Week 1 -

This week, I was supposed to create the choropleth map (http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/) containing demographic information for ASPS. I ran into MANY obstacles along the way. First of all, I realized there is no available demographic info for ASPS because of its rarity and a lack of research on the type of cancer. Consequently, I started gathering information about Sarcomas in general, which also led me no where. Finally, I decided I would make the demo map a general cancer map comparing the amount of new cases in each state. After figuring out how to get the map to show, I couldn't figure out whether I have to add my data to statesData or create a new JSON file. I'll ask about that in class Tuesday.

Also, I want to make the header fixed and the nav bar centered, but couldn't figure it out. I think it has to do with the styles set forth by the theme. I also wanted to change the background color of the nav bar, if possible.

I'm happy with the appearance of the site, so far, and that I was able to create anchor tags for the nav bar buttons.
