Week 1 -

This week, I was supposed to create the choropleth map (http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/) containing demographic information for ASPS. I ran into MANY obstacles along the way. First of all, I realized there is no available demographic info for ASPS because of its rarity and a lack of research on the type of cancer. Consequently, I started gathering information about Sarcomas in general, which also led me no where. Finally, I decided I would make the demo map a general cancer map comparing the amount of new cases in each state. After figuring out how to get the map to show, I couldn't figure out whether I have to add my data to statesData or create a new JSON file. I'll ask about that in class Tuesday.

Also, I want to make the header fixed and the nav bar centered, but couldn't figure it out. I think it has to do with the styles set forth by the theme. I also wanted to change the background color of the nav bar, if possible.

I'm happy with the appearance of the site, so far, and that I was able to create anchor tags for the nav bar buttons.

Week 2/3 -

This week, I tackled both Weeks 2 & 3 assignments. I finally figured out why my Choropleth map was broken (undefined variables from using bits of code from different tutorials). Also, I completed the map with clinical trials locations and information. This map took me FOREVER because of the amount of data involved.

I've deemed the diagram basically impossible at this point and filled the "What is ASPS?" section with text from Dr. Wilky's (the doctor who I've been working with and whose research I've been basing the site on) blog and linked it. Dr. Wilky also said to hold off on it anyways because she's drawing up new graphics based on new research. I was thinking of including a HighCharts bar chart comparing different types of cancer and the amount of research they receive (hopefully communicating that we need more research on Sarcomas) to make up for the missing component of my project.

Also, there is no available information currently to construct my History timeline. Dr. Wilky originally said she would have that information over to me by now, but now she says she's still working on compiling it. The only point I could include on the timeline is when the disease was first described and characterized in 1952. I could just make the timeline with one point and then add on as I get information, but I thought it might look stupid with just one point.

Lastly, I could not figure out how to center the buttons in the navbar to save my life. I even tried meddling with the theme's css, but that didn't work. I also wanted to position the navbar as fixed, but it gets stuck 100px from the top of the screen because of the header's positioning. I still have to make the header and navbar responsive to smaller screens before turning it in on Monday.
